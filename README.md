Todo List

This is a web application that uses the React framework. I programmed this project to help myself learn React and get familiar with componenets, states, props and JSX. I also used materialize to slightly style the page

To run the program: - 
  1. Clone the repo
  2. Type "npm install" to install the node_modules
  3. Open up a terminal within the directory
  4. Type in "npm start" -> this will open up a server on your browser and you will be able to view the application.
  
Using the application: - 
  - The user will be shown a title with two tasks to comeplete along with an input bar
  - The user can delete tasks by clicking on them; when there are no more tasks, a message will be displayed
  - To add tasks, simply type in a task in the text box and hit enter
  - The user will now be able to view their task
  
  
What I learnt : -
